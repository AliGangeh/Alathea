# Alathea
Using NLP to find the truth in News

Politics is becoming more and more polarized by the day. If you switch on any news channel, you will often find very extreme opinions. We named ourselves Team Alathea (the Greek Goddess of truth) because we hope to bring a little more truth into the world. Using Google Clouds Natural Language Processing API, we can perform Sentiment analysis, which analyzes whether the article contains positive or negative emotion (score) and the intensity of the emotion (magnitude.) Our program analyzes said score and magnitude to categorize articles and give warnings to readers if theyâ€™re reading only one side of the story.


This repository does not contain the full sourcecode because the `static/` and `templates/` directories contain too many files for me to rapidly push in the hour I have left to submit this project.
